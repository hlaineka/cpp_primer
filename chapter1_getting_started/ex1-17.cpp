//Exercises Section 1.4.4
//Exercise 1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values are all equal?
//What if there are no duplicated values?
//Exercise 1.18: Compile and run the program from this section giving it only equal  values  as  input.
//Run  it  again  giving  it  values  in  which  no  number  is repeated.
//Exercise 1.19: Revise the program you wrote for the exercises in ยง 1.4.1 (p.13) that printed a range of
//numbers so that it handles input in which the firstnumber is smaller than the second - Already does that!
