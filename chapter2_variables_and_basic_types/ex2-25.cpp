//Exercise  2.25:  Determine  the  types  and  values  of  each  of  the  following variables.
//(a)int* ip, &r = ip; this is not valid? reference of type int can not be tied to a int pointer
//(b)int i, *ip = 0; declares an uninitialized int i, and a int pointer initialized to NULL
//(c)int* ip, ip2; declares but does not initialize a int pointer ip and an int ip2
