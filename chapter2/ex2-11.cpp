//or a definition:
//(a)extern int ix = 1024; definition, the initialization of ix overrides extern
//(b)int iy; definition, initializes iy as 0 and makes an associated entitiy.
//(c)extern int iz; declaration (note to self: you can use this in .h file, then in
//in some .cpp file define int iz; and assign a number to it. From another cpp file you
//can then read straigth iz.)
